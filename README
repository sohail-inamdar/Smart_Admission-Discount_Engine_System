# Smart Admission & Discount Engine System

## Overview
This is a modular Admission Management System implemented in C.
The system allows student registration, course & batch creation, and dynamic discount application.

## Architecture
The project follows modular design:

- student.c       -> Student management
- course.c        -> Course management
- batch.c         -> Batch management
- discount.c      -> Flexible discount engine
- registration.c  -> Registration & payment calculation
- main.c          -> Menu-driven UI

Business logic is separated into different modules.

## Discount Strategy

The system supports:

- Flat discount
- Percentage discount

Discount logic is NOT hardcoded.
Admin can dynamically create new discounts.

Only ONE discount is allowed per registration.

The discount engine calculates final payable amount using:

finalAmount = applyDiscount(fee, discount);

This design is extendable for:
- Early Bird Discount
- Loyalty Discount
- Individual Discount
- Group Discount

## Assumptions

- Data stored in memory (no database)
- Email uniqueness not strictly validated
- Date validation not implemented (can be extended)

gcc main.c student.c course.c batch.c discount.c registration.c -o app

Run:

./app
